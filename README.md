# Overview

This repository contains solutions to various exercises using JavaScript array methods. The exercises are categorized into basic and advanced levels. It has arrays of names, provinces, and products


Welcome to the "DJS06 PROJECT | HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS" project. In this project,I have dived deep into practicing JavaScript array methods like `forEach`, `map`, `sort`, `filter`, and `reduce`. These exercises have been a great way to enhance my understanding of higher-order functions and how they can be used to manipulate arrays and data effectively.

## Technologies Used
- Vs code
- HTML
- CSS

## Usage

The exercises have proven to be an excellent way to gain hands-on experience with JavaScript array methods, providing a structured approach to solving common programming tasks. By working through these exercises, I have had the chance to improve my skills and gain confidence in dealing with array manipulations and data transformations.

### Styling Elements: 

I've taken care to organize the code snippets in a way that makes it easy to read and understand. Each exercise is clearly separated with descriptive comments to explain the purpose and how the problem was tackled.

**Challenges Faced**: Initially, I found it a bit challenging.

### Areas for Improvement

As I reflect on this project, I realize there are a few areas where I can continue to improve:

- Experimenting with additional array methods and exploring their real-world applications.
- Diving deeper into advanced topics like functional programming concepts and more complex array manipulation techniques.
- Taking time to practice writing more complex algorithms using higher-order functions and arrays.

## Reflections

After completing these exercises, I'm taking some time to reflect on the learning journey:

- **Understanding of Array Methods**: It's interesting to see how much I've grasped the concepts of higher-order functions and how they can make certain tasks more manageable.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: It's been great to evaluate my problem-solving strategies and apply the right array methods to each task.
- **Code Efficiency**: I've also been reflecting on how efficient and readable my code solutions have been for each of the exercises.

# Overall Learning Experience:

This project has been an incredibly valuable learning experience for me. I feel like I've gained a much better understanding of array methods and higher-order functions in JavaScript. I'm looking forward to continuing this learning journey and honing my skills in array manipulations and data transformations.

### Exercises DJS06 PROJECT | HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS

1. **ForEach Basics**: We use `forEach` to iterate over arrays and perform specific actions. In this exercise, we log each name and province to the console, followed by logging each name with its matching province in the format "Name (Province)".

2. **Uppercase Transformation**: By using `map`, we create a new array of province names in uppercase and log the resulting array.

3. **Name Lengths**: With `map`, we create an array containing the length of each name in the `names` array.

4. **Sorting**: Sorting provinces alphabetically using the `sort` method.

5. **Filtering Cape**: We use `filter` to remove provinces containing the word "Cape" and then display the count of remaining provinces.

6. **Finding 'S'**: Creating a boolean array with `map` and `some` to check if a name contains the letter 'S'.

7. **Creating Object Mapping**: Utilizing `reduce` to transform the `names` array into an object mapping each name to its respective province.

### Advanced Exercises (Single `console.log` Execution)

For the advanced exercises, I combined multiple operations into a single `console.log` statement:

1. **Log Products**: Iterating and logging each product name from the `products` array.

2. **Filter by Name Length**: Filtering out products with names longer than 5 characters.

3. **Price Manipulation**: Filtering out products without prices, converting string prices to numbers, and calculating the total price using `reduce`.

4. **Concatenate Product Names**: Using `reduce` to concatenate all product names into a single string.

5. **Find Extremes in Prices**: Identifying the highest and lowest-priced items and formatting the result as "Highest: X. Lowest: Y."

6. **Object Transformation**: Recreating the `products` object with keys 'name' and 'cost' using `Object.entries` and `reduce`.
